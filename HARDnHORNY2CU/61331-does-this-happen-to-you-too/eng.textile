Does this happen to you too?

Before I get in the shower, I always turn on the water so that has a few minutes to get warm before I get in. I'll usually brush my teeth or trim my nails...play on my phone, etc for however long while the shower is warming up.

Almost instantly when I turn the shower on I feel the need to pee. Doesn't matter if I had to go to begin with or not. In the time I wait for the shower to warm up I usually find myself needing to go more and more. Which always leads to leaking or squirting quite a bit while I'm waiting to get in.

Of course the leaking brings on the arousal which leads to masturbating in the shower. Sometimes I start before I get in.

Guess who is getting ready to shower and has been squirting all over the bathroom rugs.

Does this happen to anyone else?

The funny part is that I know to expect it but forget all about it until I'm suddenly squirming around trying to pinch off squirt after squirt.

Hot water does it every time. A couple of weeks ago I was getting in the jacuzzi and I was barely able to get my first foot into the water when I lost all control
