Hi! I’ve been extremely busy and inactive for a couple months now but I’m hoping to post more soon!

Lately I’ve been spending a lot of time playing Detroit: become human & spiderman and it’s been keeping me very glued to my seat. I’ve also been upping my water intake after accidentally becoming dehydrated a few times recently. This has lead to many leaky situations. I subconsciously started wearing pants that were more absorbent like thick sweatpants for this exact reason and only realised recently, it made me laugh. My brain just kinda knew I’m not gonna get up to pee, and by the time i do, it’ll be dripping down my thigh before i get to the toilet. I’ve been using checkpoints in games as guides of when to go to the bathroom next rather than pausing- like complete three chapters of DBH and you can go. So far I’ve only had small/half accidents, but I’m definitely pushing my luck, so we’ll see.
