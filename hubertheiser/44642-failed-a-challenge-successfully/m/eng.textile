I treated myself with a little challenge from Fap Roulette the other day. These were the rules:

Wear whatever clothes you like. Drink 0.5 liter of water immediately. Drink 0.5 liter of water per half hour. Hold for 3.5 hours after you feel the first need to pee. Relief (pee in your clothes for 1/2 second) is allowed every 5 minutes. Remembering how nice the double-layered underwear and jeans wetting felt which I did a while ago I decided to take it a bit further today. Count layers yourself.

Before I started the challenge, I was already well primed with a 1.5 liter of green tea during the afternoon. So all those layers of clothing gave me a little pressure on my bladder almost immediately. About one hour into the challenge when I was sure it was pee pressure and not just a little uncomfortable the holding timer was started.

After starting the timer, I made good use of the allowed relief. It's amazing how much "relief" this massive layers of fabric could take before it shows on the outside. And how comfortably warm it stays under all those layers. Finally, about 2.5 hours into the challege and 1.5 hours into the, the intended relief turned into an unstoppable and most enjoyable flood.
