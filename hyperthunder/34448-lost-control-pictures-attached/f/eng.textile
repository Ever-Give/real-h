To start things off, I have a fairly strong bladder. If I haven't drank much, I can comfortably hold up to around 14 hours. Any peeing that's done by me is either done in the toilet or in my jeans on purpose. I have never lost control since I was little. I guess today was one of those days where I ended up drinking a lot of water, but I didn't feel it until about an hour ago. It wasn't urgent, so I just ignored it. I had a small wet patch on my jeans, but dribbling isn't a big deal for me so I didn't think twice about it. 

By the time I really needed to go, my bladder felt all swollen and it hurt really badly. I was only a few feet away from my bathroom but it hurt too much to move. Pee started shooting out in small streams that I tried to suppress, but after a few minutes, I couldn't stop myself from losing control. I had been holding pee for half a day and it showed as my legs gradually became soaked by my sticky, warm urine. My light denim blue jeans are now a much darker color, as shown in the pictures.
