My sister is currently visiting us this week and the first thing she said when she entered my room was, "Is everything all right? It smells like pee here." I shrugged off her accusation, but decided that I couldn't risk her finding out that I wet my jeans.

She's out with her friends tonight and I haven't peed all day and I was reading downstairs and leaked a little into my underwear so I rushed to my room and let out a little more. I gradually let more and more out until I couldn't stop. The pee reached my feet and my jeans are soaked, but hopefully I'll be able to cover up my accident before my sister returns.$$

She keeps asking about the smell whenever she's in my room, but I think she believes that it's my dogs fault!
