This morning, I woke up and left the house in a hurry without peeing. I went on a short road trip and stopped for lunch. I enjoyed a mango daiquiri with my meal, along with a lot of water. I was wearing pale blue jeans during the trip and I didn't change when I got home. Eventually, my drinks caught up with me and I started dribbling. I even tried using my hand to stop the pee because I was busy and I didn't want to pee my pants but I didn't want to use the restroom as well. My efforts were pointless and now my jeans are really cold and they're clinging to my legs. The darker patch on my pants is lovely, though. My jeans are glistening from the absurd amount of pee I had been holding.
